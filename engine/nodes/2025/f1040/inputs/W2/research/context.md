# W2 — Wage and Tax Statement

## Overview

The W2 screen captures all data from IRS Form W-2, the Wage and Tax Statement issued by an employer to each employee. It is the primary source of earned income for the 1040 and drives federal income tax, FICA tax credits, withholding credits, and several downstream forms.

**What this screen captures:** Every box from the taxpayer's W-2 — employer/employee identification, wage amounts, FICA amounts, Box 12 benefit codes, checkboxes, and state/local tax data.

**What it feeds:**
- Box 1 wages → Form 1040, Line 1a (total wages)
- Box 2 withholding → Form 1040, Line 25a (federal tax withheld from W-2s)
- Box 8 allocated tips → Form 4137 → Form 1040, Line 1c (tip income not in Box 1)
- Box 10 dependent care → Form 2441
- Box 12 codes → various (Form 8889, Schedule 1, Schedule 2, Schedule 3, etc.)
- Box 13 checkboxes → Schedule C (statutory employee), IRA deduction phase-out
- Boxes 15–20 state → state return

**Upstream inputs:** Employer issues W-2; no prior-year screen feeds this directly. Multiple W-2 instances are allowed (one per employer).

**IRS Form:** W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement)
**Drake Screen:** W2 (General tab of Data Entry Menu)
**Tax Year:** 2025

## Calculation Logic

### Step 1 — Aggregate W-2 Boxes Across All Instances

When a taxpayer has multiple W-2s, sum these fields across all instances before computing:

```
total_wages      = SUM(box_1_wages)          → Form 1040 Line 1a
total_fed_w/h    = SUM(box_2_fed_withheld)    → Form 1040 Line 25a
total_ss_wages   = SUM(box_3_ss_wages)        → used in Step 2
total_ss_w/h     = SUM(box_4_ss_withheld)     → used in Step 3
total_med_wages  = SUM(box_5_medicare_wages)  → Form 8959 Line 1
total_med_w/h    = SUM(box_6_medicare_withheld) → credited
total_alloc_tips = SUM(box_8_allocated_tips)  → Form 4137
total_dep_care   = SUM(box_10_dep_care)       → Form 2441
```

> **Source:** IRS 1040 Instructions, Lines 1a, 25a — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi

---

### Step 2 — Social Security Excess Withholding Check

Applies only if taxpayer had 2+ employers with total SS wages > $176,100.

```
max_ss_tax = $176,100 × 0.062 = $10,918.20

IF total_ss_w/h > $10,918.20 AND 2+ employers:
  excess_ss = total_ss_w/h - $10,918.20
  → Schedule 3, Line 11 (refundable credit)

IF single employer over-withheld:
  taxpayer must contact employer for refund
  NOT a 1040 credit
```

> **Source:** Schedule 3 instructions, Line 11; SSA COLA 2025 Fact Sheet ($176,100 wage base) — https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/colafacts2025.pdf

---

### Step 3 — Additional Medicare Tax (Form 8959)

Triggered when combined Medicare wages exceed filing-status threshold.

**Employer withholding trigger:** Employer must begin withholding extra 0.9% once an individual employee's wages on that W-2 exceed $200,000 during the calendar year. This extra withholding appears in Box 6.

**Final reconciliation at return level:**

```
thresholds:
  MFJ    = $250,000
  MFS    = $125,000
  Single/HOH/QSS = $200,000

combined_med_wages = SUM all W-2 Box 5
combined_rrta      = (if applicable)
combined_se_income = (if applicable)

Part I of Form 8959:
  Line 1 = combined_med_wages
  Line 2 = unreported tips (Form 4137 Line 6)
  Line 3 = wages from Form 8919 Line 6
  Line 4 = total of Lines 1–3
  Line 5 = threshold for filing status
  Line 6 = max(Line 4 - Line 5, 0)
  Line 7 = Line 6 × 0.009
  → This is the AMT Medicare on wages

Line 18 total AMT → Schedule 2, Line 11 → Form 1040 total tax
AMT already withheld in Box 6 → Form 1040 Line 25c (reconciliation)
```

> **Source:** IRS Instructions for Form 8959, Lines 1–18 — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8959

---

### Step 4 — Dependent Care Benefits (Box 10 → Form 2441)

```
IF box_10_dep_care > 0:
  → Form 2441, Part III
  exclusion_limit = $5,000 (or $2,500 if MFS)
  taxable_dep_care = max(box_10_dep_care - exclusion_limit, 0)
  IF taxable_dep_care > 0:
    → Form 2441, Line 26 → Form 1040, Line 1e
```

> **Source:** Form 2441 Instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2441

---

### Step 5 — IRA Deduction Phase-Out (Box 13 Retirement Plan Checkbox)

```
IF box_13_retirement_plan = true (for taxpayer or spouse):
  APPLY phase-out to traditional IRA deduction:

  Single/HOH (covered):
    Full deduction if MAGI ≤ $79,000
    Partial if MAGI $79,001–$89,000
    No deduction if MAGI > $89,000

  MFJ (covered spouse contributes):
    Full if MAGI ≤ $126,000
    Partial if MAGI $126,001–$146,000
    No deduction if MAGI > $146,000

  MFJ (non-covered spouse contributes, covered spouse has plan):
    Full if MAGI ≤ $236,000
    Partial if MAGI $236,001–$246,000
    No deduction if MAGI > $246,000

  MFS (covered):
    Partial always if MAGI $0–$10,000
    No deduction if MAGI > $10,000
```

---

### Step 6 — Allocated Tips (Box 8 → Form 4137)

```
IF box_8_allocated_tips > 0:
  Taxpayer must file Form 4137
  Form 4137 computes SS and Medicare tax on unreported tips
  Result flows to:
    - Unreported tip income → Form 1040 Line 1c (added to total wages)
    - SS/Medicare tax on tips → Schedule 2
```

> **Source:** IRS Form 4137 Instructions; iw2w3 Box 8 instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2w3

---

### Step 7 — Statutory Employee (Box 13 Checkbox)

```
IF box_13_statutory_employee = true:
  W-2 wages do NOT go to Form 1040 Line 1a
  Instead: wages go to Schedule C as self-employment income
  Employee pays SE tax on these wages
  Box 2 withholding still credited on Line 25a (withholding from statutory W-2 is valid)
```

### Step 9 — Archer MSA (Box 12 Code R → Form 8853 Part I)

Triggered when any W-2 Box 12 has Code R (employer Archer MSA contributions).

```
Form 8853 Part I — Line-by-Line:

  Line 1 = Code R amount from all W-2 Box 12 (employer contributions for the year)
           [This is the input from W-2]

  Line 2 = Employee's own Archer MSA contributions for the year
           (from employee's records; does not include rollovers)

  Line 3 = Allowable contribution limit (from Line 3 Limitation Chart and Worksheet):
           Self-only HDHP: 65% of annual deductible
             (deductible range $2,850–$4,300 TY2025; max limit $2,795 if deductible = $4,300)
           Family HDHP: 75% of annual deductible
             (deductible range $5,700–$8,550 TY2025; max limit $6,413 if deductible = $8,550)
           Prorated monthly if not enrolled all 12 months.

  Line 4 = Lesser of compensation for the year or Line 3
           (compensation ceiling; deduction cannot exceed earned income)

  Line 5 = Allowable deduction = min(Line 3, Line 4)

  IF (Line 1 + Line 2) > Line 5:
    excess_contributions = (Line 1 + Line 2) - Line 5
    Excess employee contributions: must be withdrawn by tax return due date + extensions
      to avoid additional tax. If not withdrawn: file Form 5329 for 6% excise tax.
    Excess employer contributions: included as income on return unless timely withdrawn.
    → Form 5329 calculates additional tax on remaining excess amounts.

  Line 5 result → Schedule 1, Line 23 (Archer MSA deduction — employee portion only)
  Employer contributions (Line 1) are excluded from income if ≤ Line 5; no Schedule 1 entry.
```

### Step 10 — Adoption Benefits (Box 12 Code T → Form 8839 Part III)

Triggered when any W-2 Box 12 has Code T (employer-provided adoption benefits).

```
Form 8839 Part III — Employer-Provided Adoption Benefits (Lines 19–31):

  Line 19 = Maximum exclusion per child = $17,280 (TY2025)
  Line 20 = Benefits excluded in prior years for same child
  Line 21 = Current year employer-provided benefits (= Code T amount from W-2)
  Line 22 = Total benefits received across all years (= Line 20 + Line 21)
  Line 23 = Smaller of Line 19 or Line 22 (total potentially excludable)
  Line 24 = Excludable amount (special needs child rules may allow full exclusion)

  Phase-out calculation (Lines 25–27):
    Line 25 = Modified AGI (same computation as for the adoption credit)
    Phase-out begins at $259,190 MAGI (TY2025)
    Complete phase-out at $299,190 MAGI (TY2025; $40,000 phase-out range)
    Phase-out fraction = (MAGI - $259,190) / $40,000
    Reduction = Line 23 or Line 24 × phase-out fraction
    Line 27 = Reduced excludable amount after phase-out

  Line 30 = Final exclusion amount (enter on Form 2441 line or as excluded from income)
  Line 31 = Taxable adoption benefits = Code T amount - Line 30
    → If Line 31 > 0: amount flows to Form 1040, Line 1f (employer-paid adoption benefits)

Exclusion vs. Credit distinction:
  - Part III computes the EXCLUSION (employer-provided benefits not included in income)
  - Part II computes the CREDIT (for out-of-pocket qualified adoption expenses paid by employee)
  - The same qualified adoption expenses CANNOT receive both the exclusion and the credit
  - Maximum $17,280 per child applies separately to exclusion and credit

For special needs adoptions: full exclusion ($17,280) is allowed regardless of actual expenses.

### Step 11 — Saver's Credit (Box 12 Codes D/E/G → Form 8880)

Triggered when any of these conditions are met:
- Box 12 Code D, E, G, AA, BB, EE (retirement deferrals) and AGI is within Saver's Credit range
- Taxpayer made IRA contributions
- Box 13 retirement plan checkbox does NOT prevent eligibility (separate determination)

```

    Head of Household: $59,250
    Married Filing Jointly: $79,000

  Credit rate tiers (TY2025):
    Filing Status      | 50%        | 20%              | 10%              | 0%
    Single/MFS/QSS     | ≤$23,750   | $23,751–$25,500  | $25,501–$39,500  | >$39,500
    Head of Household  | ≤$35,625   | $35,626–$38,250  | $38,251–$59,250  | >$59,250
    MFJ                | ≤$47,500   | $47,501–$51,000  | $51,001–$79,000  | >$79,000

  Form 8880 line flow:
    Line 1 = Total qualified retirement contributions (IRA + employer plan)
    Line 2 = Elective deferrals from W-2 Box 12:
             Codes D (401k), E (403b), G (457b), AA (Roth 401k),
             BB (Roth 403b), EE (Roth 457b), S (SIMPLE), F (SAR-SEP)
             + voluntary employee contributions to defined contribution plans
    Line 3 = Distributions from qualified plans in testing period
             (2 years before + current year)
    Line 4 = Net contributions = Line 1 + Line 2 - Line 3
    Line 5 = Amount of line 4 for taxpayer (max $2,000)
    Line 6 = Amount of line 4 for spouse (max $2,000, MFJ only)
    Line 7 = Credit rate from table above (0.5, 0.2, or 0.1)
    Line 8 = Credit = (Line 5 + Line 6) × Line 7 rate

  Maximum credit: $1,000 per person ($2,000 for MFJ)
  This is a NONREFUNDABLE credit → flows to Schedule 3, Line 4

## Edge Cases & Special Rules

### 1. Multiple Employers — Excess SS Withholding

When a taxpayer works for 2+ employers and combined wages exceed $176,100, each employer withholds SS tax on their wages up to $176,100. The combined Box 4 total may exceed $10,918.20. The excess is a **refundable credit** on Schedule 3 Line 11.

**Rule:** Only applies when multiple employers caused the over-withholding. If one employer over-withheld, the employee must get a corrected W-2 (W-2c) from that employer — not a 1040 credit.

> **Source:** Schedule 3 instructions, Line 11; IRS Topic 608 — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi

---

### 2. Additional Medicare Tax — Multi-Employer / Spouse Income Situation

Employer withholds extra 0.9% once wages on a single W-2 exceed $200,000. But the actual threshold depends on filing status:
- MFJ threshold: $250,000 — a high-earning spouse may have over-withheld AMT on their W-2 that is credit against less-than-expected AMT on the joint return
- MFS threshold: $125,000 — taxpayer may OWE more AMT than withheld if spouse's W-2 was factored separately

These over/under situations are reconciled on Form 8959, which flows to Schedule 2 Line 11 (additional tax) and Line 25c (additional withholding credit).

> **Source:** i8959 instructions, General Instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8959

---

### 3. Statutory Employee (Box 13 Checked)

Wages from a statutory employee W-2 go to Schedule C, not Line 1a. The taxpayer ALSO pays SE tax (self-employment tax via Schedule SE) on these wages. Box 2 withholding is still credited. This is unusual — most W-2 employees pay zero SE tax.

Categories of statutory employees: agent-drivers/commission-drivers, life insurance salespeople, home workers (piece-rate), traveling/city salespeople.

> **Source:** iw2w3, Box 13; IRS Pub 15-A — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2w3

---

### 4. Allocated Tips (Box 8)

Allocated tips are NOT in Box 1. The employer allocated tips using IRS methods (hours worked, gross receipts, good faith agreement) because reported tips were less than 8% of gross receipts.

Taxpayer must file Form 4137. Taxpayer can dispute the allocation if they have records showing actual tips. If reported on Form 4137: amount → Line 1c on 1040, SS/Medicare tax on tips → Schedule 2.

> **Source:** iw2w3, Box 8; Form 4137 instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2w3

---

### 5. Multiple W-2 Instances for One Employer — Split State Reporting

A taxpayer may receive a single W-2 showing wages in 14+ states. Drake allows 4 states on the main W2 screen + 10 on Additional Entries tab (14 total). If the taxpayer has more than 14 states, Drake uses multiple W2 screen instances. When splitting across multiple W2 screens for the same employer:
- Federal Box 1 must be allocated proportionally across instances based on state amounts
- Total Box 1 across all instances must equal the actual W-2 Box 1 amount

> **Source:** kb.drakesoftware.com/kb/Drake-Tax/10378.htm

---

### 6. Box 12 Code D/E/G — SECURE 2.0 Enhanced Catch-Up (Ages 60–63)

Starting 2025, employees ages 60–63 may make enhanced catch-up contributions:
- 401(k)/403(b)/457(b): $11,250 additional (vs. $7,500 for 50+)
- Total possible for ages 60–63: $23,500 + $11,250 = $34,750

These appear in the same Box 12 Code D/E/G as regular deferrals. The engine should validate: Code D + Code AA ≤ $34,750 if taxpayer is age 60–63, ≤ $31,000 if 50–59, ≤ $23,500 if under 50.

> **Source:** IRS Notice 2024-80 (IR-2024-285) — https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/401k-limit-increases-to-23500-for-2025-ira-limit-remains-7000

---

### 7. Box 12 Code W — HSA Employer Contributions and Form 8889 Interaction

Code W amount flows to Form 8889, Part II (Line 9). It reduces the employee's own deductible HSA contribution for the year. If employer contributions alone reach the limit ($4,300 self-only / $8,550 family), employee contributions are not deductible.

> **Source:** iw2w3, Box 12, Code W; Form 8889 instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2w3

---

### 8. Box 10 — Dependent Care Benefits Exceeding Limit

If Box 10 > $5,000 (or > $2,500 MFS), the excess is included in Box 1 wages AND reported on Form 2441 Line 26 → Form 1040 Line 1e. This is a situation where wages are effectively double-counted: Box 1 includes the excess, and Line 1e also reports it — but Form 2441 handles the netting correctly.

> **Source:** iw2w3, Box 10; Form 2441 instructions — https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i2441

---

### 9. OBBB Codes (TA, TP, TT) and Box 14b — TY2025 vs TY2026 Distinction

**Critical:** The IRS W-2/W-3 instructions at https://www.irs.gov/instructions/iw2w3 currently show **2026 instructions** (not 2025). Several new features only apply to the **2026 Form W-2** (TY2026 wages):

- **Code TA (Trump Account employer contributions):** Effective July 4, 2026 — NOT applicable to TY2025. Do not implement.
- **Code TP (Total Cash Tips):** NOT on 2025 Form W-2. IRS issued penalty relief: "Forms W-2 and 1099 for tax year 2025 will not be updated to account for the OBBB-related changes."
- **Code TT (Total Qualified Overtime):** NOT on 2025 Form W-2. Same penalty relief — no 2025 W-2 reporting.

**Box 14b (Treasury Tipped Occupation Code):** Box 14 was split into 14a (Other) and 14b (Tipped Occupation Code) starting with **the 2025 Form W-2** — so this IS applicable to TY2025. Employers in tipping industries report the IRS occupation code here.

**"No Tax on Tips" Deduction for TY2025:** Available under P.L. 119-21 (OBBBA) for tax years beginning after 2024. Employees can deduct up to $25,000 of qualified tips on Schedule 1, even though TY2025 W-2s don't include Code TP. IRS is providing forthcoming guidance on how to claim without W-2 tracking. The engine should support a separate tips deduction input for TY2025, not tied to W-2 Box 12.

---

### 10. MFS Filing and IRA Phase-Out

Married filing separately taxpayer who is covered by a retirement plan (Box 13 checked) has the harshest IRA phase-out: $0 to $10,000 of MAGI. Any MAGI above $10,000 means zero IRA deduction. This applies regardless of whether the MFS spouse has retirement plan coverage.

> **Source:** IRS Notice 2024-80; Pub 590-A — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-24-80.pdf

---

### 11. Box 14 — State SDI and PFML Mappings

Per IRS Revenue Ruling 2025-4 (effective January 1, 2025), employee contributions to state-mandated paid family and medical leave (PFML) and state disability insurance (SDI) programs are:
- **Included in federal wages** (withheld after-tax, subject to FICA)
- **Deductible on Schedule A, Line 5a** as state income taxes paid, IF the taxpayer itemizes
- **Subject to the $10,000 SALT cap** (§164(b)(6)) combined with other state and local taxes

The engine must support a `is_state_sdi_pfml` flag on each Box 14 entry. When flagged, the amount flows to Schedule A Line 5a (state and local income taxes), not merely informational.

**State-by-State Box 14 Mapping:**

| State Program | Common Box 14 Label | Federal Schedule A Treatment | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| CA State Disability Insurance | SDI, CASDI | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| NY State Disability Insurance | NY SDI, NY SUI | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| NJ Family Leave Insurance | NJ FLI, FLI | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| NJ State Disability Insurance | NJ SDI, SDI | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| OR Paid Leave Oregon | OR PFML, OPFML | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| WA Paid Family & Medical Leave | WA PFML, WAPFML | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| MA Paid Family & Medical Leave | MA PFML, MAPFML | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible as state income tax | Taxpayer itemizes; subject to $10k SALT cap |
| Other state SDI/PFML programs | Varies | Schedule A Line 5a — deductible if mandatory state program | Taxpayer itemizes; employer must confirm mandatory status |

**Engine requirements:**
1. Each Box 14 entry must have a `category` field with possible values: `informational`, `state_sdi_pfml`, `other_deductible`, `union_dues`, `other`
2. When `category = state_sdi_pfml`: amount → Schedule A Line 5a aggregate (pooled with Box 17 state withholding for SALT cap check)
3. The $10,000 SALT cap applies to the combined total of: Box 17 state income tax withheld + Box 19 local income tax withheld + Box 14 SDI/PFML amounts
4. Transition relief: IRS allows 2025 transition period for employer reporting compliance (Notice 2026-6). For TY2025 returns, treat all mandatory state SDI/PFML withholding as deductible per Rev. Ruling 2025-4.
