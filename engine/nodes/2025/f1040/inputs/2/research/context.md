# General 2 — Drake Filing Information Screen Cluster

## Overview

Drake's "General 2" screen cluster (screen code "2") captures all filing information needed to complete Form 1040 pages 2–3 (Payments, Refund, Amount You Owe sections) and the associated e-file authorization forms. It spans seven sub-screens on Drake's General tab:

| Drake Screen | Description |
|---|---|
| **ES** | Estimated Tax — taxes already paid by quarter, next-year vouchers, overpayment application |
| **DD** | Direct Deposit — bank account(s) for refund allocation (Form 8888) |
| **PMT** | Electronic Funds Withdrawal — direct debit of balance due or ES payments |
| **PIN** | IRS e-file Signature Authorization — Form 8879, taxpayer/spouse PINs, IP PINs |
| **PREP** | Preparer Overrides — third-party designee, preparer override fields |
| **MISC** | Miscellaneous Return Options — special signatures (POA, taxpayer for spouse) |
| **EF** | E-file Selections — which federal/state returns to e-file |

**What it feeds into:** Form 1040 Lines 25c (other federal withholding), 26 (estimated tax payments), 35a–35d (refund/direct deposit), 36 (applied to next year), 37 (amount owed), 38 (estimated tax penalty). Also produces Form 8879, Form 8888, Form 8878.

**Why it matters:** These screens are the last data entry step before e-filing. They control payment routing, electronic signature authority, refund disbursement, and underpayment penalty calculations. Errors here cause failed transmissions, misdirected refunds, or IRS penalties.

**IRS Forms:** Form 1040 (multiple lines), Form 8879 (e-file signature), Form 8888 (refund allocation), Form 2210 (underpayment penalty), Form 8878 (extension signature)
**Drake Screen:** General tab — ES, DD, PMT, PIN, PREP, MISC, EF sub-screens
**Tax Year:** 2025

## Calculation Logic

### Step 1 — Total Estimated Tax Payments (Form 1040 Line 26)

Sum all estimated tax payments made during TY2025:

```
line_26 = es_q1_amount_paid
         + es_q2_amount_paid
         + es_q3_amount_paid
         + es_q4_amount_paid
         + es_overpayment_from_prior_year
```

No cap. Each payment is at the amount actually paid, on the date actually paid (use override dates if different from standard quarterly dates).

Standard quarterly due dates for TY2025 payments (confirmed from Form 2210 instructions):
- Q1: April 15, 2025 (column (a) header of Part III penalty worksheet)
- Q2: June 15, 2025 (column (b) header — note: NOT June 16; the June 16 was a Drake default prior to 2025)
- Q3: September 15, 2025 (column (c) header)
- Q4: January 15, 2026 (column (d) header)

If a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the payment is considered timely if made on the next business day.

> **Source:** Form 2210 Instructions TY2025, Part III, Line 10 "Payment due dates," pp. 3–4; Penalty Worksheet headers — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2210.pdf

---

### Step 2 — Overpayment Applied to Next Year (Form 1040 Line 36)

If taxpayer elects to apply part or all of the refund to next year's estimated taxes:

```
line_36 = es_overpayment_to_apply_next_year
```

Constraints:
- `line_36 ≤ line_34` (amount overpaid — cannot apply more than the total overpayment)
- This election is **irrevocable** — once the return is filed, the amount cannot be changed
- The IRS will apply the overpayment to the spouse's account only if taxpayer includes a statement with spouse's SSN

> **Source:** Form 1040 Instructions TY2025, Line 36, p.63 — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf

---

### Step 3 — Refund (Form 1040 Lines 35a–35d) or Amount Owed (Line 37)

Line 34 = Amount overpaid (computed by the engine from all other form lines):
```
line_34 = line_33 (total payments) - line_24 (total tax)
```

If line_34 > 0 (overpayment / refund):
```
line_35a = line_34 - line_36   (refund after applying overpayment to next year)
```
- If line_35a > 0: direct deposit data (Lines 35b-35d) or Form 8888 is produced
- Note: "Starting in October 2025, the IRS will generally stop issuing paper checks for federal disbursements, including tax refunds, unless an exception applies." (1040 Instructions p.62)

If line_34 ≤ 0 (amount owed):
```
line_37 = line_24 (total tax) - line_33 (total payments)   [Line 37 = amount you owe]
line_37 += line_38   (add estimated tax penalty from Form 2210)
```

The balance due deadline is April 15, 2026 for most taxpayers. The IRS will not charge penalty interest if penalty is paid by the date specified on any IRS bill.

---

### Step 4 — Direct Deposit Routing

If refund exists (line_35a > 0):

```
if dd_accounts_count == 1:
    → refund flows to Form 1040 lines 35b (RTN), 35c (type), 35d (account number)
    → Form 8888 NOT produced

if dd_accounts_count == 2 or 3:
    → Form 8888 produced
    → each account gets the amount specified in dd_acctN_federal_deposit_amount
    → if deposit amounts don't sum to total refund, remainder issues as paper check
    → max 3 accounts total
    → IRS limit: no more than 3 direct deposits per routing/account combination per year
```

> **Source:** 1040 Instructions TY2025, Lines 35a–35d, pp.61–63 ("Your refund can be split and directly deposited into up to three different accounts on Form 8888"; "The number of refunds that can be directly deposited to a single account or prepaid debit card is limited to three a year") — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf; Drake Manual p.145–146

---

### Step 5 — Underpayment Penalty (Form 2210)

Form 2210 is generated automatically when underpayment exists. The penalty is figured separately for each installment period.

**When penalty applies:**
```
for each installment period (a=Q1, b=Q2, c=Q3, d=Q4):
  underpayment[period] = required_installment[period] - actual_payment_by_due_date[period]
  if underpayment[period] > 0:
    penalty[period] = underpayment[period] × (days_late / 365) × 0.07
```

**Penalty rate: 7% per annum for all four TY2025 rate periods:**
- Period 1: April 16, 2025 – June 30, 2025
- Period 2: July 1, 2025 – September 30, 2025
- Period 3: October 1, 2025 – December 31, 2025
- Period 4: January 1, 2026 – April 15, 2026

**Safe harbor — no penalty if either:**
1. **90% test:** Total TY2025 withholding + ES payments ≥ 90% of TY2025 total tax (line 24), OR
2. **Prior year test:** Total TY2025 withholding + ES payments ≥ 100% of TY2024 total tax (line 24 on prior return), OR if TY2024 AGI > $150,000 ($75,000 MFS): ≥ 110% of TY2024 total tax

**Additional exception:** No penalty if:
- Total TY2025 tax minus withholding < $1,000, OR
- Prior year return showed no tax liability AND taxpayer was U.S. citizen/resident all of 2024

**IRS will figure the penalty for taxpayer** unless Form 2210 boxes B, C, or D are checked. Leave Line 38 blank and IRS will bill if penalty is owed.

**Required annual payment** (Form 2210, Part I):
```
required_annual_payment = smaller of:
  (a) 90% × TY2025 tax, or
  (b) 100% (or 110%) × TY2024 tax
```

Each quarterly installment = required_annual_payment ÷ 4.

**Override:** If es_2210_code = "N", Form 2210 is suppressed entirely.

---

### Step 6 — Electronic Signature (Form 8879)

An e-filed return requires electronic signatures from both taxpayer and ERO:

1. Taxpayer selects 5-digit PIN (any except 00000)
2. PIN entered on PIN screen; date entered on PIN screen
3. If direct debit: Direct Debit Consent box must be checked
4. Program generates Form 8879 with:
   - Taxpayer PIN (Part I)
   - ERO's practitioner PIN (from Setup > Preparers and Users)
   - Signature date (Part II)
5. Form 8879 is NOT mailed to IRS; retained by ERO for 3 years
6. IP PINs (taxpayer, spouse, dependent) are transmitted in e-file record but NOT printed on return

> **Source:** 1040 Instructions TY2025, "Requirements for an Electronic Return," "Identity Protection PIN," pp.65–66 — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf; Drake Manual p.152–154; IRS Form 8879 — https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8879

## Edge Cases & Special Rules

### Rule 1 — Multiple Direct Deposit Accounts Trigger Form 8888

When 2 or 3 bank accounts are entered on the DD screen, Drake produces Form 8888 instead of using Lines 35b–35d of Form 1040. Conditions for Form 8888:
- Accounts must be checking, savings, IRA, MSA, or similar
- All accounts must be in the taxpayer's or spouse's name
- Maximum 3 accounts

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.145–146

---

### Rule 2 — IRS 3-Deposit Limit Per Account

The IRS limits direct deposits to 3 refunds per routing/account combination per year. If a 4th deposit would go to the same account (across multiple clients/years), the IRS issues a paper check.

> **Source:** 1040 Instructions TY2025, Lines 35a–35d, p.61 ("The number of refunds that can be directly deposited to a single account or prepaid debit card is limited to three a year. Learn more at IRS.gov/DepositLimit.") — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf; Drake Manual p.145

---

### Rule 3 — Payment Date Constraints for Direct Debit

If PMT screen is used:
- Filed on or before April 15, 2025: requested payment date must be on or before April 15, 2025
- Filed after April 15, 2025: requested payment date cannot be later than the current date (effectively immediate)
- Program default: balance due debited on return due date

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.149

---

### Rule 4 — Direct Debit Consent Required on PIN Screen

If direct debit (PMT screen) is active, the "Direct Debit Consent" box on the PIN screen MUST be checked. If not checked, an EF Message is generated and the return cannot be e-filed.

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.150, 153

---

### Rule 5 — IP PIN Is Not Printed on Return

Taxpayer, spouse, and dependent IP PINs are transmitted electronically in the IRS e-file transmission record. They do NOT appear on the printed Form 1040 or Form 8879. The dependent IP PIN is entered on Drake's screen 2 (Dependents tab) at the bottom right.

### Rule 6 — Prior Year Safe Harbor Threshold: 110% Rule

If TY2024 AGI exceeded $150,000 (or $75,000 for MFS), safe harbor requires payments equal to 110% of TY2024 total tax. If AGI was $150,000 or below, the threshold is 100% of TY2024 total tax.

> **Source:** Form 2210 Instructions TY2025, "Who Must Pay the Underpayment Penalty — Higher income taxpayers," p.1 ("If your adjusted gross income (AGI) for 2024 was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if your 2025 filing status is married filing separately), substitute 110% for 100% in (2) above.") — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i2210.pdf

---

### Rule 7 — ES Payment Vouchers: Missed Quarter Handling

If a quarterly payment is missed, Drake adds the missed amount to the next available voucher. To explicitly indicate a quarter was skipped, enter "0" (zero) in that quarter's Voucher field in the Estimate Amt column. Do NOT leave it blank.

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.140

---

### Rule 8 — Form 8879 Retention

Form 8879 (and Form 8878 for extensions) must be retained by the ERO for 3 years. They are NOT transmitted to the IRS and NOT mailed. The IRS can request them during an audit of the ERO.

> **Source:** Form 8879 Instructions; Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.152

---

### Rule 9 — Third-Party Designee PIN Requirement

If a preparer or ERO is selected as third-party designee, a PIN must be entered in the preparer's setup (Setup > Preparers and Users > PIN signature field). If no PIN is set up, the designee's name does NOT appear on Form 1040 and the "No" box is marked.

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.151 (footnote 1)

---

### Rule 10 — Power of Attorney: Form 2848 Is Not E-Fileable

If the return is signed under Power of Attorney (MISC screen: "Return signed by Power of Attorney" checkbox), Form 8453 is generated as a transmittal. Form 2848 itself must be printed and mailed or faxed to the IRS separately. For MFJ, two Form 2848s are required.

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.154

---

### Rule 11 — ES Code N Suppresses Estimated Tax Penalty Calculation

Setting 2210 Code = "N" on screen 1 completely suppresses Form 2210 and the estimated tax penalty calculation. Use only when the taxpayer qualifies for an exception (e.g., casualty, disaster). If the taxpayer does NOT qualify and N is selected, this results in an underreported penalty.

> **Source:** Drake Tax Manual 2024, p.143

---

### Rule 12 — Paper Check Phase-Out (October 2025)

The IRS stopped issuing paper checks for federal disbursements including tax refunds starting in October 2025, unless an exception applies. The 1040 instructions state: "Starting in October 2025, the IRS will generally stop issuing paper checks for federal disbursements, including tax refunds, unless an exception applies. For more information, go to IRS.gov/ModernPayments." Preparers should proactively collect bank account data for direct deposit.

> **Source:** 1040 Instructions TY2025, Lines 35a–35d, p.62 — https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf

---

### Rule 13 — Foreign Bank Account Warning

Marking "Foreign" on the DD screen triggers an EF Message instructing the preparer to change to a U.S.-based account. No states support International ACH Transactions (IAT) as of filing season 2024.
