      joint return)." URL verified accessible. $300 single / $600 MFJ is
      authoritative.

      Box 2a capital gain distributions. (A) Standard: Schedule D Line 13. (B)
      Simplified exception: if taxpayer has NO other capital transactions

      non-deductible indefinitely under current law. Source: IRS

## Calculation Logic Notes

### Schedule B Routing

- Trigger: Box 1a total across ALL 1099-DIV payers > $1,500 → Schedule B
  required
- Also required if: received dividends as nominee, foreign accounts, etc.
- Schedule B Part II Line 5: list each payer + Box 1a amount
- Nominee: subtotal all, subtract "Nominee Distribution," result = Line 6
- Schedule B Line 6 → Form 1040 Line 3b

### Form 1040 Lines

- Line 3b (Ordinary Dividends) ← Schedule B Line 6 (or Box 1a direct if Schedule
  B not required)
- Line 3a (Qualified Dividends) ← Box 1b (entered directly, not via Schedule B)
- Line 2a (Tax-Exempt Interest) ← Box 12

### Qualified Dividends Tax Treatment

- Uses Qualified Dividends and Capital Gain Tax Worksheet (in Form 1040
  instructions)
- Required when: taxpayer has qualified dividends OR net long-term capital gains
- If Schedule D required: use Schedule D Tax Worksheet instead
- Rates (2025): 0% / 15% / 20% based on taxable income

### Capital Gain Distributions (Box 2a)

- → Schedule D Line 13 (long-term capital gain distribution)
- Sub-amounts flow to their respective worksheets:
  - Box 2b (Unrecap §1250): Unrecaptured §1250 Gain Worksheet (25% rate)
  - Box 2c (§1202): Schedule D, QSBS exclusion computation
  - Box 2d (28% collectibles): 28% Rate Gain Worksheet

### Section 199A Routing

- Box 5 → Form 8995 Line 6 (simplified) or Form 8995-A
- 8995-A required if taxable income > $197,300 single / $394,600 MFJ
- 20% deduction on qualified REIT dividends
- Holding period: must hold REIT stock > 45 days in 91-day window

### Foreign Tax Credit Routing (Box 7)

Path A (Simplified — no Form 1116):

- All conditions: all foreign income is passive, reported on qualified payee
  statements, total foreign tax ≤ $300 (single) / $600 (MFJ), holding period met
  (16+ days in 31-day window), no excluded income
- → Schedule 3 Line 1 (foreign tax credit directly) Path B (Full — Form 1116):
- Box 7 amount → Form 1116 Part II
- Passive income basket
- Credit = lesser of foreign tax paid or US tax attributable to foreign income
- Carryback 1 year, carryforward 10 years

### AMT Routing (Box 13)

- Box 13 (Specified PAB Interest Dividends) → Form 6251 Line 2g
- 2025 AMT exemptions: $88,100 single, $137,000 MFJ

### Exempt Interest (Box 12)

- Box 12 → Form 1040 Line 2a (tax-exempt interest, not taxable)
- Box 12 includes Box 13 amount (PAB interest is subset of exempt-interest
  dividends)

### Liquidating Distributions (Boxes 9 & 10)

- NOT included in ordinary dividends (not in Box 1a)
- Treatment: reduce basis in stock first; any excess = capital gain (long-term
  if held > 1 year)
- Report on Form 8949 / Schedule D once basis is fully recovered or liquidation
  is complete
- Noncash (Box 10): use FMV at date of distribution

### Backup Withholding (Box 4)

- → Form 1040 as federal tax withheld (Schedule 3 or directly on Form 1040)

### Nondividend Distributions (Box 3)

- Return of capital; not taxable
- Reduces taxpayer's basis in the stock
- No current-year form routing; tracked in basis records only

### Investment Expenses (Box 6)

- Included in Box 1a gross income under §67(c)
- TCJA 2017: §67(a) miscellaneous itemized deductions suspended 2018–2025
- Box 6 amount: increases income (via 1a) but no offsetting deduction available
  2025
- Post-2025: deduction may resume if TCJA provisions expire

## Unresolved Items

All items resolved. No open questions remain.

1. $300/$600 foreign tax threshold — RESOLVED. Form 1116 instructions (i1116)
   exact text confirmed: "not more than $300 ($600 if married filing a joint
   return)."
2. Schedule D Line 13 vs Form 1040 Line 7a — RESOLVED. Both paths confirmed:
   Schedule D Line 13 (standard) OR Form 1040 Line 7a (simplified exception when
   no other Schedule D transactions). IRS FAQ and Schedule D instructions both
   confirm.
3. Box 6 TCJA suspension / 2026 return — RESOLVED. Investment expense deduction
   will NOT return. One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L. 119-21, signed July
   4, 2025) permanently eliminated miscellaneous itemized deductions under
   §67(g). Context.md updated.
