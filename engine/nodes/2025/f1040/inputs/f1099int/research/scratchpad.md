# Scratchpad: 1099-INT Screen Research

## Status

Phase 5 complete — Rule 13 applied (2026-03-27). See Rule 13 findings below.

## Open Questions

- [x] Does Drake INT screen expose box 10 (market discount) directly, or is that
      OID screen only? **Answer:** Yes, box 10 (market discount) IS on the Drake
      INT screen. Drake KB 14216 (EF Message 5285) explicitly states that the
      "Amount that is" subtotals on the INT screen must not exceed "the total
      taxable interest entered on lines 1, 3, and 10," confirming box 10 is a
      standard INT screen input field. Source:

- [x] Does Drake INT screen have a separate CUSIP/account number field (box 14)?
      **Answer:** Yes. The Drake INT screen has an "Account number" field in the
      header section that corresponds to IRS Form 1099-INT Box 14 (labeled
      "Tax-Exempt and Tax Credit Bond CUSIP No." on the form). The field is
      informational and applies to both tax-exempt bonds and tax credit bonds
      (Build America Bonds, etc.). Source: IRS i1099int
      https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099int (Box 14 instructions); Drake KB
      11742 header field listing.

- [x] What is Drake's exact field code for the INT screen (e.g., `INT` —
      confirmed from KB)? **Answer:** Confirmed: `INT`. Already documented in
      the Resolved Questions table below. Source: Drake KB 11742
      https://kb.drakesoftware.com/kb/Drake-Tax/11742.htm

- [x] Does Drake have a "covered security" checkbox on the INT screen for bond
      premium? **Answer:** No. There is NO covered security checkbox on the
      Drake INT screen, nor on the IRS Form 1099-INT itself. The term "covered
      security" in the 1099-INT instructions (Box 11 instructions, citing Reg.
      §1.6045-1(a)(15)) describes a definitional threshold that determines
      whether the _payer_ must report bond premium — it is not a recipient-side
      checkbox. When a covered bond is reported, the payer populates boxes
      11/12/13; the recipient's software simply uses whatever dollar amount the
      payer entered. No UI checkbox is needed. Sources: IRS i1099int
      https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1099int (Box 11 instructions); Drake KB
      13580 confirms "covered security" is a 1099-B concept, not 1099-INT.

- [x] MeF XML element path for 1099-INT data — needs IRS MeF schema research
      **Answer:** The IRS IRIS XML schemas (for information return e-filing,
      including 1099-INT) and the IRS MeF 1040-series schemas (which reference
      Schedule B interest data) are both distributed exclusively through the IRS
      Secure Object Repository (SOR) mailbox, accessible only to registered
      software developers with an approved IRIS Transmitter Control Code (TCC)
      or e-Services account. No publicly verifiable URL exists for the 1099-INT
      XSD schema. Per iron rule (nothing without a verifiable reference), MeF
      XML element paths cannot be documented in context.md. Instead, a [!] note
      is added directing the implementation team to obtain schemas via the IRS
      SOR. Sources:

## Constants Confirmed for TY2025

- Schedule B required: total taxable interest + ordinary dividends > $1,500
- Foreign tax credit without Form 1116: ≤$300 single, ≤$600 MFJ (passive income
  only, all reported on 1099)
- 1099-INT filing threshold: $10 (or $600 if paid in trade/business)
- Seller-financed mortgage: Schedule B must include payer name, address, SSN
  (else $50 penalty)

## Edge Cases — All Resolved

- Nominee interest: enter full 1099-INT amount, subtract in ABP Adjustment block
  labeled "Nominee Distribution"
- Accrued interest on bond purchase: same mechanism, labeled "Accrued Interest"
  on Schedule B
- AMT on PAB: box 9 → Form 6251 line 2g; already included in box 8 total
- OID on INT screen: if OID ≥ $1,500 enter on INT screen; if < $1,500 can use
  Screen 3
- U.S. savings bonds: cash method taxpayers may defer until redemption; accrual
  method annual; Form 8815 for education exclusion
- Foreign tax credit: simple method (no Form 1116) if ≤$300/$600 and all passive
  category income
- Box 13 bond premium on tax-exempt: reduces 1040 line 2a (not a deduction, just
  netting)
- Box 5 investment expenses: suspended by TCJA through at least 2025 — no
  deduction
- Market discount (box 10): only reported if §1278(b) election made by payer;
  otherwise no box 10 value

## Rule 13 Findings (2026-03-27)

### Gap 1 — Downstream line numbers

All line numbers were already explicit in context.md (Form 1040 Lines 2a/2b/25b,
Schedule 1 Line 18, Schedule 3 Line 1, Form 6251 Line 2g, Schedule B Lines 1-4).
Added exact IRS label text to clarify: Schedule 1 Line 18 = "Penalty on Early
Withdrawal of Savings"; Schedule 3 Line 1 = "Foreign Tax Credit"; Form 6251 Line
2g = "Interest From Private Activity Bonds". No missing line numbers found.

### Gap 2 — Cross-field validation rules with numeric tolerances

Rewrote §10 validation rules table with:

- Box 9 ≤ Box 8 (per payer): IRS i1099int; Form 6251 instructions — retained
- Box 13 ≤ Box 8 (per payer): Treas. Reg. §1.171-2 — corrected: excess is
  nondeductible loss, not "reduces basis" alone
- Box 11 > Box 1: **CORRECTED** — prior text said "capital loss"; correct rule
  is §171(a)(1) excess DEDUCTION with prior-period inclusion limit (Treas. Reg.
  §1.171-2). Not a capital loss.
- Box 12 > Box 3: same §171 excess deduction treatment — new warning added
- Added warning rule for box 6 > 0 with no box 1/3 income

### Gap 3 — Secondary form flows

- **Form 6251 Line 2g**: Updated §4.4 — box 9 is NOT a direct pass-through; must
  be reduced (but not below zero) by deductions allowable if interest were
  includible in gross income. Under TCJA, for most taxpayers the reduction = $0,
  but the logic must be implemented. Added full step-by-step.
- **Schedule 1 Line 18**: Confirmed no cap — deduction can exceed interest
  earned. Already in context.md.
- **Form 8815**: Added complete new §4.11 with all eligibility conditions (5
  conditions), MAGI phase-out thresholds ($99,500–$114,500 single;
  $149,250–$179,250 MFJ for TY2025), engine architecture note. Source: IRS
  Pub 970.
- **Foreign tax credit simplified method**: Added 4th condition (not
  estate/trust) — was missing from prior version. Confirmed only 4 conditions
  exist per IRS i1116 (not 5 as stated in the prompt).

### Gap 4 — "Verify"/"TBD" language

Remaining flag: `[!] NEEDS VERIFICATION` on Pub 1220 amount codes (§11.2). This
flag is retained with full explanation: source URL is known
(https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1220.pdf), reason is PDF not text-parseable in
research session. Iron rule satisfied — it's a developer verification action
with a specific source and reason.

### Gap 5 — State fields (Boxes 15-17)

Updated §3.2 box table and §9 downstream outputs to explicitly state: "Out of
scope for federal engine — passed to state engine as-is." Added note in box 17
entry that federal engine does NOT route box 17 to Form 1040 line 25b.

### New sources added

- Source 14: IRS Publication 970 (Form 8815 eligibility and phase-out
  thresholds)
- Source 15: Treas. Reg. §1.171-2 (bond premium excess treatment — Cornell LII)
- Source 16: IRC §171 (bond premium amortization statute — Cornell LII)
