# Roadmap: 1040 Drake Parity — Node Coverage Expansion

## Overview

Build ~45 missing tax nodes in 9 phases of 5 nodes each, expanding coverage from 46.6% to ~85-90% of all computational Drake screens. Every phase uses the `build-tax-node` skill: Research → Black-Box Tests → Implementation for each node.

## Phases

- [ ] **Phase 1: Self-Employed & Retirement (Batch 1)** - SEP retirement, NOL carryforward, Form 3800, Form 2106, LTC premium
- [ ] **Phase 2: Deductions & Worksheets (Batch 2)** - Sales tax deduction, auto expense, depletion, Form 8582-CR, lump-sum SS
- [ ] **Phase 3: Special Situations A (Batch 3)** - Clergy, Form 8915-F, Form 8915-D, Form 5405, household wages
- [ ] **Phase 4: Special Situations B (Batch 4)** - Foreign employer compensation, QSEHRA, Form 8917, Form 8867, Form 8859
- [ ] **Phase 5: Specialty Credits A (Batch 5)** - Form 8820, Form 8828, Form 8835, Form 8844, Form 8864
- [ ] **Phase 6: Specialty Credits B (Batch 6)** - Form 8896, Form 8912, Form 8978, Form 8611, PPP informational
- [ ] **Phase 7: Schema Extensions & Form 7203 (Batch 7)** - K-1 QBI fields, K-1 basis extensions, Form 7203, f4835 CIDP
- [ ] **Phase 8: International Simple (Batch 8)** - Form 8833, Form 8840, Form 8843, Form 8082, Form 8805
- [ ] **Phase 9: International Complex (Batch 9)** - Form 8854, Form 8873, Form 8288, Form 8621, Form 965-A/C/D/E
