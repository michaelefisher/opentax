# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** Accurate, IRS-compliant computation: given a set of form inputs, produce the correct tax liability.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — core-engine-foundation

## Current Status

- Milestone: 1 — W-2 + Line 1a MVP
- Active Phase: Phase 02 — W-2 + Line 1a Nodes
- Current Plan: 02-01 (next phase)
- Last action: Completed 01-02-PLAN.md (2026-03-27)

## Phase Progress

- [x] Phase 1 Plan 01: Workspace + Type System — COMPLETE (2026-03-27)
- [x] Phase 1 Plan 02: Planner + Executor — COMPLETE (2026-03-27)
- [ ] Phase 2: W-2 + Line 1a Nodes
- [ ] Phase 3: CLI + Return Storage

## Decisions

- **01-01:** TaxNode is a generic abstract class parameterized by TSchema extends z.ZodTypeAny — enforces Zod at the type level
- **01-01:** NodeOutput.input is Readonly<Record<string, unknown>> — immutable, flexible shape for arbitrary node payloads
- **01-01:** NodeRegistry is Readonly<Record<string, TaxNode>> — maps nodeType strings to instances
- [Phase 01-02]: Scalar-to-array promotion: second deposit of same key promotes to array — core W-2 wages accumulation pattern
- [Phase 01-02]: Planner runs start.compute() with actual inputs to discover instances — not purely static metadata
- [Phase 02]: StartNode emits pre-suffixed w2_01/w2_02 IDs; planner strips suffix via baseNodeType() for registry lookup
- [Phase 02]: Line01zWagesNode is a leaf — pending holds accumulated input; Phase 3 CLI calls compute() to extract line_1a total

## Performance Metrics

| Phase | Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|-------|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01    | 01   | 2min     | 2     | 7     |
| 01    | 02   | 3min     | 2     | 5     |
| Phase 02 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 7 files |

## Notes

Phase 01 complete. Deno workspace, core type system, planner, and executor all established.
Ready to proceed to Phase 02 (W-2 + line_01z node implementations).
