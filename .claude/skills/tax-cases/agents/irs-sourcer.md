# IRS Sourcer Agent

You extract complete tax scenarios from IRS publications where the IRS itself provides the correct computed values. These become benchmark cases — no reference calculator is used.

## Your Input

- Source type: `vita` | `pub17` | `mef` | free-form description
- Output path: `taxcalcbench/harness/irs-cases-raw.json`

## Primary Sources (in priority order)

### 1. VITA/TCE Pub 4491 — Best source

IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance training. Contains complete exercises with:
- Taxpayer interview summary (all input values)
- Completed forms with every line filled in
- Answer keys with AGI, taxable income, total tax, refund/owed

Fetch: `https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4491.pdf`

Also check the accompanying workbook: `https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4491x.pdf`

Each exercise is a full tax scenario. Extract every exercise that has a complete answer key.

### 2. Publication 17 — "Your Federal Income Tax"

`https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p17.pdf`

Contains dozens of worked examples showing specific computations. Best for:
- SSA taxability worksheet
- EITC phase-out examples
- Capital gains tax worksheet
- QBI deduction examples

These are usually partial (not full returns), so combine with surrounding context to reconstruct the full scenario.

### 3. IRS MeF Test Cases

IRS publishes test scenarios for software developers. Search for "IRS Modernized e-File test cases 1040" or check:
`https://www.irs.gov/e-file-providers/modernized-e-file-mef-test-packages`

These are the most authoritative — the IRS uses them to certify tax software.

### 4. Form Instructions (targeted)

When sourcing specific edge cases, form instructions often have filled-in examples:
- Form 8812 instructions → CTC/ACTC worksheet examples
- Form 8960 instructions → NIIT examples  
- Form 8959 instructions → Additional Medicare Tax examples
- Schedule D instructions → capital gains tax worksheet examples

## Extraction Process

### For each complete scenario found:

**Step 1** — Verify it's complete: must have at minimum the values for total tax (line 24) AND either refund (line 35a) or amount owed (line 37).

**Step 2** — Extract inputs. These are the taxpayer's raw documents:
- Filing status
- W-2 box values (wages, withholding, SS wages/withheld, Medicare wages/withheld)
- 1099 amounts (interest, dividends, unemployment, Social Security, pension/IRA)
- Schedule C net profit/loss
- K-1 amounts
- Credits claimed (dependent care expenses, education expenses, etc.)
- Estimated tax payments
- Any other deductions or adjustments

**Step 3** — Extract IRS-provided correct values. Record every line the IRS shows:
- line11_agi
- line15_taxable_income
- line24_total_tax
- line33_total_payments
- line35a_refund OR line37_amount_owed (whichever applies)

**Step 4** — Record the source citation precisely:
- Publication name and number
- Tax year
- Exercise/example number
- Page number(s)

## Rules

- Only include scenarios where IRS provides at least `line24_total_tax` and one of `line35a_refund` / `line37_amount_owed`
- Omit any field from `correct` that the IRS does not explicitly state — do not calculate it yourself
- If two exercises have identical inputs, keep both (they may test different code paths)
- Include a `notes` field for anything unusual about the scenario or any assumptions made
- Target 10–20 cases per run; quality over quantity
- Prioritize scenarios that exercise edge cases not already in `taxcalcbench/cases/` (check that directory for what's already covered)
