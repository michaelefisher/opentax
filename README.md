Fully open-source federal tax software. Single binary. Runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

Built and maintained by AI agents using official IRS publications as the sole source of truth.

> Covers Form 1040 (TY2025) today. Additional forms and state returns coming.

## Why

Professional tax software is closed source and is a critical piece of software for taxpayers and professionals. It was expensive to build and keep updated since it required manual updates to the codebase every time the rules changed.

With AI agents, the cost of building and maintaining tax software has dropped drastically. It only makes sense that we use them to build and maintain our tax software in the open. This project aims to be the first truly open-source and up-to-date tax software that can work for everyone.

The software is designed for the AI era -- designed to be run by AI agents more than humans. AI agents are proficient with CLI tools. This tax software is a single binary CLI that an AI agent can download and run. Everything is stored locally, keeping the software truly open, secure, and accessible.

## Example: single W-2 filer

```bash
$ opentax return create --year 2025
{ "returnId": "a1b2c3" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type general '{"filing_status": "single"}'
{ "id": "general_01", "nodeType": "general" }

$ opentax form add --returnId a1b2c3 --node_type w2 '{"box1_wages": 55000, "box2_fed_withheld": 5200}'
{ "id": "w2_01", "nodeType": "w2" }

$ opentax return get --returnId a1b2c3
```

```json
{
  "returnId": "a1b2c3",
  "year": 2025,
  "summary": {
    "line1z_total_wages": 55000,
    "line9_total_income": 55000,
    "line11_agi": 55000,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  },
  "lines": {
    "filing_status": "single",
    "line1a_wages": 55000,
    "line12a_standard_deduction": 15750,
    "line15_taxable_income": 39250,
    "line16_income_tax": 4471.5,
    "line24_total_tax": 4471.5,
    "line25a_w2_withheld": 5200,
    "line33_total_payments": 5200,
    "line34_overpayment": 728.5,
    "line35a_refund": 728.5
  }
}
```

$55,000 in wages, $15,750 standard deduction, $39,250 taxable income, $4,471.50 tax, $728.50 refund. Every line traces back to the IRS instructions.

## More commands

```bash
# Validate against IRS MeF business rules

## Use with AI agents

Hand your W-2s and 1099s to an AI assistant in plain English. It calls the engine, runs the IRS math, and shows you a finished 1040.

### Step 1: Give your AI the instructions

Download the skill file, then upload it to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any AI assistant:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filedcom/opentax/main/skills/tax-preparer/SKILL.md -o opentax-skill.md
```

Upload `opentax-skill.md` to your AI's chat and tell it to follow those instructions.

### Step 2: Ask it to prepare your return

Once it confirms it has loaded the instructions, drop in photos or PDFs of your tax documents (W-2s, 1099s, etc.) or just type in the values. Then ask it to prepare your return:

> I'm single. My W-2 shows $72,000 in wages and $9,800 withheld. Prepare my 2025 federal return.

### What to expect

The AI will download the OpenTax binary, enter your forms, and compute your return. You'll get back a full 1040 with every line item -- income, deductions, tax owed, and your refund or balance due. All math follows the official IRS instructions.

### Claude Code

If you use [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), install OpenTax as a plugin so the skill is always available:

1. Add the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace add filedcom/opentax
```

2. Install the plugin:

```
/plugin install tax-preparer@filedcom-opentax
```

3. Load the skill and ask:

```
/opentax:tax-preparer
```

> I'm single. My W-2 shows $72,000 in wages and $9,800 withheld. Prepare my 2025 federal return.

## Staying up to date

OpenTax tells you when a new version is available:

```
$ opentax return get --returnId abc-123
{ ... }

Update available: 0.1.0 → 0.2.0. Run `opentax update` to upgrade.
```

To update:

```bash
opentax update
```

That's it. The binary replaces itself with the latest release.

Check your current version anytime:

```bash
opentax version
```

## Supported forms (TY2025)

131 input nodes covering the full range of 1040 source documents -- W-2s, 1099s, all major schedules, credits, capital transactions, and more.

See [`catalog.ts`](catalog.ts) for the complete list of supported nodes and their schemas. Or from the CLI:

```bash
opentax node list
```

---

## How it's built

The engine is a directed graph of **nodes**. Each node is a pure function: validated input in, typed output out. No state, no side effects.

- Schemas defined with Zod, types inferred (never duplicated)
- Immutable data throughout -- no mutation anywhere
- Type-safe output routing between nodes enforced at compile time
- 133 real-world benchmark scenarios

AI agents maintain the codebase: reading IRS instructions, writing node implementations, generating test cases from official IRS exercises, and fixing regressions -- all traced back to the authoritative IRS source.

## Development

Requires [Deno](https://deno.land).

```bash
# Run tests
deno task test

# Run accuracy benchmark
deno task bench

# Run the CLI in dev mode
deno task tax return create --year 2025
```

### Contributing with Claude Code

The repo includes four skills that automate the full development lifecycle. Open the project in [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and invoke them with `/skill-name`.

#### `/tax-status` -- See what's passing and what's broken

Run this first. Shows pass/fail counts, pending root causes, and build phase for every form.

```
/tax-status
```

#### `/tax-fix [form:year]` -- Fix a broken form

Autonomous bug-fixing loop. Reads failing benchmark cases, clusters them by root cause, spawns parallel fixer agents, validates, and commits any net-positive improvements. Loops until all cases pass or progress stalls.

```
/tax-fix f1040:2025
```

#### `/tax-cases [source]` -- Add new benchmark cases

Sources test cases from IRS publications (VITA exercises, Pub 17, MeF test packages). Run `/tax-fix` after to see how the engine performs on the new cases.

```
/tax-cases vita                            # VITA Pub 4491 training exercises
/tax-cases pub17                           # Publication 17 worked examples
/tax-cases "senior with SSA and 1099-R"    # free-form scenario
```

#### `/tax-build [form-number]` -- Build a new form from scratch

End-to-end form builder. Researches IRS instructions, extracts ground truth, builds all nodes section by section, then runs a validate + fix loop until >= 95% of benchmark cases pass. Resumes if interrupted.

```
/tax-build 1120
```

#### Typical workflows

**Adding a new form:**

```
/tax-cases f1120:2025 vita    # source benchmark cases first
/tax-build 1120               # build nodes, iterate until >= 95% pass
/tax-status                   # confirm it's green
```

**Fixing a regression:**

```
/tax-status                   # find what's failing and why
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # autonomous fix loop
```

**Expanding test coverage:**

```
/tax-cases pub17              # pull new IRS examples
/tax-fix f1040:2025           # fix loop against expanded case set
```
