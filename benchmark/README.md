# benchmark

Accuracy benchmark for the `tax` engine — 97 TY2025 scenarios with IRS-authoritative
correct values. Passes when every engine output is within $5 of the correct value for
total tax, refund, and amount owed.

For folder layout and file formats, see [STRUCTURE.md](../docs/architecture/STRUCTURE.md).

## Cases

97 scenarios covering the common return types:

| Range | Filing status | Key features tested |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|

| 11–17 | MFJ | Both W-2, children/CTC, unemployment, dividends, Schedule C + QBI, retirement + SSA, excess SS tax |

- `line35a_refund`
- `line37_amount_owed`

## How to run

```bash
# Full benchmark
cd benchmark && deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run run_benchmark.ts

# Single case
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run run_case.ts cases/02-single-w2-basic/

# Regenerate all output.json
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-run run_all.ts
```

## Adding a new case

Use `/tax-cases` (Claude Code skill) to generate IRS-sourced cases automatically, or
create `cases/NN-description/input.json` and `correct.json` manually following the
formats in [STRUCTURE.md](../docs/architecture/STRUCTURE.md).
