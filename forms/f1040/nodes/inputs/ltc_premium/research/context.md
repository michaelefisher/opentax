# LTC Premium — Long-Term Care Insurance Premium Worksheet

## Overview

The LTC Premium Worksheet computes the eligible (deductible) long-term care insurance premium for each insured person. The eligible amount is the lesser of (a) the actual annual premium paid or (b) the age-based dollar limit set by Rev. Proc. 2024-40. The eligible amount flows to Schedule A as a medical expense (IRC §213(d)(10)).

Only premiums paid for a "qualified long-term care insurance contract" under IRC §7702B are eligible. One worksheet entry per insured person (taxpayer and/or spouse each have their own entry).

**IRS Form:** No standalone form — LTC Premium Worksheet is built into Schedule A instructions
**Drake Screen:** LTC
**Node Type:** input (per-person array)
**Tax Year:** 2025
**Drake Reference:** https://kb.drakesoftware.com/Site/Browse/10960

| ----- | ---- | -------- | -------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --- |
| `age` | `number` (integer, 0–130) | Yes | Age of insured as of December 31, 2025 | The insured's age determines the applicable dollar limit. Age on the last day of the tax year is used. | IRC §213(d)(10); Rev. Proc. 2024-40 §3.45 | https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rp-24-40.pdf |
| `actual_premium_paid` | `number` (nonnegative) | Yes | Annual LTC insurance premium paid | The total annual premium paid for the qualified LTC contract during tax year 2025. | IRC §213(d)(10) | https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040sca |
| `is_qualified_contract` | `boolean` | Yes | Is this a qualified LTC contract under IRC §7702B? | Only premiums for qualified contracts are eligible. A qualified LTC contract must: be guaranteed renewable, have no cash surrender value, provide only qualified LTC services. | IRC §7702B | https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title26-section7702B |

## Calculation Logic

### Step 1 — Validate qualified contract
If `is_qualified_contract !== true`, eligible amount = 0. No output is emitted for non-qualified contracts.
Source: IRC §213(d)(10); IRC §7702B

### Step 2 — Determine age-based limit
Look up the age bracket for the insured's age (as of December 31, 2025):
- Age ≤ 40: $480
- Age 41–50: $900
- Age 51–60: $1,800
- Age 61–70: $4,830
- Age 71+: $6,020

Source: Rev. Proc. 2024-40, §3.45, Table (TY2025 amounts)

### Step 3 — Compute eligible premium
```
eligible = min(actual_premium_paid, age_limit)
```

### Step 4 — Aggregate across all persons
Sum eligible amounts across all items (taxpayer + spouse each enter separately).

### Step 5 — Route to Schedule A
The aggregate eligible LTC premium flows to Schedule A as a medical expense. Schedule A then applies the 7.5% AGI floor.

## Edge Cases & Special Rules

1. **Non-qualified contract produces zero output.** Only IRC §7702B qualified contracts are eligible. If `is_qualified_contract` is false or omitted, the premium is entirely ineligible and no output is emitted.

2. **Premium capped at age-based limit, not reduced to zero.** If `actual_premium_paid > age_limit`, eligible = age_limit (not zero). The person still gets a deduction up to the cap.

3. **Age boundary — exactly 40.** A person who is exactly 40 on December 31, 2025, uses the ≤40 bracket ($480).

4. **Age boundary — exactly 41.** A person who is exactly 41 uses the 41–50 bracket ($900).

5. **Age boundary — exactly 71.** A person who is exactly 71 uses the 71+ bracket ($6,020).

6. **Both spouses can each enter LTC premiums separately.** The taxpayer and spouse may each have their own LTC policy; they enter separate items. Each is independently capped, then the eligible amounts are summed before flowing to Schedule A.

7. **Schedule A AGI floor applies downstream.** The `ltc_premium` node passes the gross eligible amount to `schedule_a.line_1_medical`. Schedule A then subtracts 7.5% of AGI. The LTC node does NOT apply the AGI floor — that is Schedule A's responsibility.

8. **Employer-paid LTC premiums.** Employer-paid LTC premiums are generally not deductible as a medical expense. The `actual_premium_paid` should reflect only the amounts paid by the taxpayer (not employer-paid amounts excluded from W-2).

9. **LTC benefits are separate from premiums.** LTC benefit payments received (not premiums paid) are addressed under IRC §7702B(a); this node only handles premium deductibility.
