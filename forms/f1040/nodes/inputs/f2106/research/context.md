# f2106 — Form 2106: Employee Business Expenses

## Overview

Form 2106 captures employee business expenses for the four categories of employees who may still deduct these expenses post-TCJA. For all four categories, the net deductible amount flows to Schedule 1, line 12 (above-the-line deduction).

**Critical restriction for TY2025:** TCJA (P.L. 115-97) suspended miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the 2% floor (IRC §67(g)) for 2018–2025. However, IRC §67(b) and §67(h) preserve the deduction for four specific employee categories — these deductions are NOT subject to the 2% floor and are above-the-line under IRC §62(a)(2)(E).

A separate Form 2106 is filed for each job or employment situation. Multiple 2106s are aggregated on Schedule 1.

## Calculation Logic

### Step 1 — Validate Employee Type
Only RESERVIST, PERFORMING_ARTIST, FEE_BASIS_OFFICIAL, or DISABLED_IMPAIRMENT produce output. Any other (or missing) value → no output.
Source: IRC §67(h)(1)–(4); TCJA P.L. 115-97 §11045

### Step 2 — Compute Vehicle Expenses (Line 1)
```
If vehicle_expense_method == STANDARD_MILEAGE:
  vehicle_expense = business_miles × 0.70

If vehicle_expense_method == ACTUAL_EXPENSE:
  vehicle_expense = actual_vehicle_expenses × (business_use_pct / 100)

If neither provided:
  vehicle_expense = 0
```
Source: Notice 2025-05 ($0.70/mile); IRC §280F; Form 2106 Part II

### Step 3 — Compute Meals (50% Limitation, Line 9)
```
meals_allowed = meals_expenses × 0.50
```
Source: IRC §274(n)(1); Form 2106 line 9

### Step 4 — Total Expenses (Line 6)
```
total_expenses = vehicle_expense + parking_tolls_transportation
              + travel_expenses + other_expenses + meals_allowed
```
Source: Form 2106 Part I line 6

### Step 5 — Subtract Reimbursements (Line 10)
```
net_deduction = max(0, total_expenses - employer_reimbursements)
```
Source: Form 2106 Part I line 10; IRC §62(a)(2)(A)

### Step 6 — Route to Schedule 1, Line 12
If net_deduction > 0, emit to `schedule1.line12_business_expenses`.
Source: IRC §62(a)(2)(E); Schedule 1 (Form 1040) line 12

## Edge Cases & Special Rules

1. **Non-qualifying employees produce no output.** Under TCJA, the deduction is suspended for all employees except the four enumerated categories. If `employee_type` is absent or not in the qualifying list, no output is produced.

2. **Meals 50% limitation.** Only 50% of meal expenses are deductible (IRC §274(n)). The node applies this automatically before summing totals.

3. **Reimbursements reduce deduction, cannot go negative.** If employer reimbursements exceed total expenses, the net deduction floors at zero. No income is generated on Form 2106.

4. **Standard vs. actual vehicle method.** The taxpayer must choose one method per vehicle. In the year a vehicle is placed in service, the standard mileage method must be chosen if the taxpayer wants to use it in subsequent years. The node accepts whichever method applies.

5. **Multiple 2106s.** One form per employment situation (e.g., two jobs). The engine uses array items; net deductions from all items are summed before routing to Schedule 1.

6. **Reservist travel requirement.** Armed Forces reservists can only deduct travel expenses for travel more than 100 miles from home (one-way). This is a data-entry constraint; the node trusts the entered amounts.

7. **Performing artist AGI test.** The performing artist category requires AGI (before the deduction) ≤ $16,000 ($16,000 for all filing statuses; married must use combined income). This test occurs at the Schedule 1 level — the node captures the expenses.

8. **Disability impairment routing.** Per IRS instructions, impairment-related expenses for disabled employees technically go to Schedule A, line 16. However, per IRC §67(b)(6) and §62(a)(2)(E), such expenses are treated as above-the-line (not subject to 2% floor) in the engine and route to Schedule 1, line 12.

9. **Commuting miles excluded.** Miles driven from home to regular workplace are never deductible. The `business_miles` field should exclude commuting miles — a data-entry constraint.

10. **No §179 or bonus depreciation in this node.** Vehicle depreciation limits (§280F, §168(k)) are complex multi-year calculations beyond the scope of this input node; if actual vehicle expenses are used, the user enters the depreciation amount directly in `actual_vehicle_expenses`.
